# MNIST-as-a-service

This is a personal project to familiarize myself with deployment of ML models on a Flask server. A simple Keras built neural network was trained to recognize MNIST Handwritten digits. A user can upload an image sample using "index.html" and a prediction about the sample is printed on his page.

The samples are in the main folder itself, and the model is in ML_model folder. The Flask app is written in app.py. A "requirments.txt" file is provided to setup the virtual environment if required.
